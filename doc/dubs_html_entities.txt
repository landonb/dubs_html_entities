1. About This Plugin					*dubs-htmlent-about*

This plugin helps the developer convert ASCII to
HTML Character Entities (a/k/a Special Characters)
using either an interactive table or a prompt.

Project page: https://github.com/landonb/dubs_html_entities

This code is a reworking of Christian Habermann's awesome
chartab.vim, which displays an interactive list of ASCII
character values. Check it out here:
  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=898

I lifted the list of HTML4 Character Entities from TNT Luoma:
  http://tntluoma.com/files/codes.htm (dead link)
  http://www.dwaynecasey.com/tnt-luomas-html-codes.htm (rebirth!)

`NOTE` Over the past number of years, more and more software
     recognizes Unicode, so this plugin is not as useful
     as it once was. E.g., even reStructured Text says not
     to bother with entities codes but to just use the
     actual Unicode character in the source. Now if only
     we had a nice, long list of Unicode characters from
     which to copy and paste.

`NOTE` Try the built-in, `:digraph`, to list all the
     diacritical marks. See:
      http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Entering_special_characters
     To insert a digraph, press <Ctrl-K> followed by the two
     character combination shown under `:digraph`. Dubsacks
     has <Ctrl-K> mapped to buffer-forward, so you can use
     `:set` `dg` instead, which works after a backspace,
     e.g., `<Ctrl-K>a:` could in—ïtead be typed `a<BS>:`
     Be sure ato `:set` `nodg` when you're done, otherwise you'll
     surprise yourself sometimes after a backspace.
     Hint: Try `:TabMessage` `digraph` to copy and paste digraphs.

2. Entity Table Commands				*dubs-htmlent-commands*

Interactive Entity Table~

				*<Leader>ht* *\ht*
<Leader>ht		Display interactive entity list in the 
			current window.

			You can double-click entities to copy-and-
			paste them back to the buffer you were just 
			working on, or you can just position the cursor 
			over an entity and press 'r' (or <Enter>) to do 
			the same.

			Press 'b' or 'B' to cycle forwards or backwards 
			through the set of available bases. HTML 
			recognizes three entity formats, e.g., >

			    dec: &#928; / hex: &#x3D6; / ent: &piv;
<
			(i.e., decimal, hexidecimal, and entity/
			 friendly name).

			Use 'q' or <ESC> to quit the buffer. It will 
			be destroyed and the last working buffer will 
			be displayed instead.

Interactive Entity Lookup~

				*<Leader>hT* *\hT*
<Leader>hT		Invokes the QuickLookup, which asks you to type
			an ASCII character which will be converted to
			another representation and pasted in place.

			In the command window, you should see: >

				>> Please enter a character: 
<
			Type just the single character you want
			translated (i.e., '&' (without the quotes))
			and its entity reference will be inserted into
			your working buffer at the cursor. And note
			that you don't have to hit return after typing
			the character to be translated).

Toggle Entity List Visibility~

			You can obviously map <Leader>ht to any key
			command you want, but you can also map a
			toggle function, which creates or destroys
			the interactive entity list depending on
			whether not its already visible.

			To map the toggle function to, e.g.,
			<Alt-Shift-5> (or <Alt-%>), add the
			following to your vim environment: >

				nmap <M-%> <Plug>DubsHtmlEntities_ToggleLookup
<
				*<Shift-Alt-5>* *<M-%>* *<S-M-5>* *<S-A-5>* {ToggleLookup}
<Shift-Alt-5>		Toggle HTML character entity table.
